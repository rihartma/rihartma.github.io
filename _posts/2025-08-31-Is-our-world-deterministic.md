title:  "Is our world deterministic"

I have been thinking about a classic philosophical question: Is our world governed by absolute determinism, or is there some degree of randomness? I am not a philosopher, nor have I read any texts on the topic, so perhaps my thoughts are nothing special. Nevertheless, I find the topic tremendously interesting. First, I dislike absolute statements about matters like: "Of course our world must have intrinsic randomness" or "Of course it's completely deterministic." No one knows... Personally, I consider both possibilities and try to behave or make decisions optimally given my lack of knowledge about the truth of the matter. If the world is completely deterministic and our impression of free will is illusory, then we cannot influence anything in our lives or the lives of others. But, because there is a non-zero probability that our world is not fully deterministic, I will consider its consequences and behave as if I am master of my fate. This attitude is optimal for both perspectives. If it's deterministic, it won't hurt us, and if it's not, then we have things in our hands.

I think this principle can be applied to many different philosophical and practical questions. You can lean toward certain ideas, but remain open to the possibility that you could be wrong. Try to think or behave game theoretically, meaning anything can be true. In that case, is my behavior optimal, am I ready for every possible outcome?

Just a cool though about deterministic world: What if our world was controlled by a pseudorandom generator and God chose some seed during the Big Bang? Since then, everything has been deterministic, (but to us, observers, it could be indistinguishable from a world with randomness...)
